  <h2>Describe selected social issues and your choice of visualizations</h2>
  <p>
    The following analysis will highlight the disparity in public services in the metro-DC area, also known as the
    DMV (D.C., Maryland, Virginia), and specifically between historically marginalized areas and wealthier neighborhoods.
    For public goods, there is an inverse relationship between income and access to public services–those in marginalized
    communities (low-income, communities of color, disabled individuals, etc.). This means that public entities should focus
    on expanding transit to farther neighborhoods, prioritizing needs-based distribution over any monetary gain. In its
    development, DMV public entities have largely followed business strategy practices, focusing on metro areas in favor
    of political influence, and failing to provide for marginalized communities. 
  </p>
  <p>
    D.C. hosts both a rail system and a city bus system. The first visualization highlights two significant factors in
    the rail system: the black lines represent the major transit lines, and the pink gradient indicates the volume of
    traffic in a given zone. In contrast, the black dots represent the density of low-income individuals. This highlights
    the disparity between the areas with the most significant transportation needs and where public transit is actually
    available. The second visualization displays similar patterns but provides a more comprehensive view of relative needs,
    highlighting and comparing areas of transportation need and high densities of marginalized communities. The last
    visualization illustrates patterns in city bus service, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when public 
    transportationavailability was particularly low.

  <h2> Visualizations and your critiques</h2>

    <p class="caption">
      This visualization provides a clear picture of the density of low-income individuals and available transit lines,
      particularly how they don’t overlap. The graph is particularly strong in its clarity and efficiency. To provide
      visual clarity with conciseness, the legend has very minimal, digestible language. By using only a few shades
      to communicate areas of high and low need, both the visualization and legend are easy to understand. Interestingly,
      the minimal interface contributes to the strong context that this visualization provides–by having very few visual
      components and variables, the context (and purpose) of this visualization are very easily interpreted.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      This minimal interface also allows the reader to focus on the important features: the use of luminance and point
      density for perception ordering, and the clear indication of transit lines. The color scheme highlights disparity
      across the district, also highlighting areas of high density, which represent low-income individuals. Overlaid
      with the transit lines, there are apparent areas, like Langley Park (just north of DC, near College Park) and
      Baileys Crossroads (Virginia suburbs), with high densities of low-income households, but no public transit line.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      The representation of need is also direct and spatially accurate, as each dotrepresents 100 individuals, ensuring
      the map itself remains uncluttered. The minimal color gradients also help prevent clutter on a map, which has a
      static scale, thereby contributing to its accuracy.

    <p class="caption">
      The second exhibit shows transit equity through proximity to transit options and demographic overlays of
      marginalized communities. The visualization uses simple color-coding and density shading to distinguish between
      populations within a reasonable distance to bus stops (¼ mile), enabling readers to grasp the spatial disparities
      in transit access quickly. The visualization also engages readers by quantifying access to transit into understandable
      distances, rather than an arbitrary “poor access” value. The map view also helps to provide an accurate scale of the
      areas impacted by transit disparities.
    </p>
    <p class="caption">
      On the other hand, this graph lacks clarity due to the use of bright yellow hues to highlight public land and parks.
      The bright yellow hues suggest an association with the brighter blue hues, which is distracting, especially at first
      glance when considering pre-attentive patterns. These public lands and parks, which are essentially “null” spaces,
      should be shaded with lighter gray or neutral colors to provide greater clarity.

      The third exhibit provides similar context and data with a certain level of accuracy, but also lacks certain 
      visualization principles. Exhibit C illustrates the impact of transit equity during the COVID-19 pandemic, a
      period when public transit service was particularly limited. The visualization provides strong context–it
      outlines specific areas along a positive/negative color spectrum (within and not within a reasonable distance
      to a bus stop), depicts bus line availability along major routes, and plots on a static map.
    </p>

    <p class="caption">
      On the flipside, the graph employs a large number of categories and color bands, resulting in visual clutter
      that overwhelms readers and diminishes clarity. This excessive segmentation also forces the viewer into slower
      serial processing, resulting in marginally less nuance (fewer categories, such as Exhibit A, are easier to grasp).
      Similarly, despite the additional detail the positive/negative spectrum provides, the overall color scheme adds
      complexity by introducing clashing hues and luminance, distracting the reader from the main message
